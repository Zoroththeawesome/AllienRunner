# AllienRunner

This is the result of following along with a tutorial provided by Clear Code. I did this simply to learn and have fun.
I post it here to show off some of the things I have done in my free time that relate to the use of python.

While he listed no license on his GitHub the video was clear that anyone was allowed to use and distribute this code.
I simply feel the need to give credit where it is due.

While I did code this all myself in the sense that I typed it I was following instructions for the majority of it. The only original part coded by me was to make the backgrounds move, however there seems to be an issue with that. The image for the road moves just fine but the image for the background is having issues. I invite anyone who is willing and able to help me fix this issue. Also note the music is currently commented out as I am still trying to fix the background. To enable it simply uncomment out the relevant code.

A Mit license has been attached to this because I created some pixel art to go along with this to change the theme.
I did this because all I want is for people to give me credit if they use my pixel art (though it’s not very good, being my first attempt, so I am not sure why you would).
